# web

This is the front-end client app for CharlotteRoadReports. This app is built using Create React App, see related documentation for commands on how to use this project.

In order to server this react app in production make sure it is built and the build is output to this web folder (`/web/build`) so it can be accessed by the `server` binary when self serving is enabled.

Otherwise you can serve this front-end however you like and proxy it to the back-end
